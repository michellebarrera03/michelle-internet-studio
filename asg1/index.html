	<h1>Assignment 1</h1>
	<h2>Three things I learned in the reading material</h2>
	<ul>
	<li> First thing I learned was from the Reading Material: Chapter 0. 
	I learned how to design, code, and publish ethical web-based projects.
	But also maintaing the historical meaning.</li>
	<li>Second thing I learned was in the 2nd reading: Evolution Of Web.
	This article is about how the web went from basic static pages- Web 1.0,
	to something a bit more social like web 2.0, later we got a more smarter
	and more diverse tech.</li>
	<li> Third thing I learned was in the 3rd reading: The wax and wane of 
	the Web. This reading was more like a history book over the web. Goes over 
	the messy beginnings to how things ended up now. It also mentions how it's
	important to keep learning from mistakes and current web trends to continue
	to make the web better.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>My Semester Project</h2>
<p>So far my idea for the semester project is a website for digital stickers 
(similar to memes). The website would let artist upload thier own set of stickers.
These stickers can be downloaded and used in text message converstations, similar
to how people use emojis in everyday text messages. Users can go through different 
catagpries of stickers, download them, and even folow their favorite artist. This
site could really help up and coming artist and give them a space to share their
art. I'm still brainstorming a few other things, but for now this is the base idea. 
Still working on a name and domain name but for now I have:<li>stiki</li>
<li>stikee</li><li>stickies</li><li>istick</li></p>
